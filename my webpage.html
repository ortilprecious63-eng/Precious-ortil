    <H3>KNOW MORE ABOUT PRECIOUS</H3>
    <p>I am a determined individual with a unique educational journey. Starting school at 5, I navigated various institutions, including Messaih Nursery and Primary School and Shalom Nursery and Primary School, before graduating primary school at 13.  Proceeded to my secondary school at GSS Gboko which I dropped out after my Jss1. After a brief delay, I resumed my education, writing my BECE  at SDSS Tyowanye and later graduating from Nkst Secondary School Mkar, Gboko. I then attended College of Education before transitioning to Benue State University (now MOAU), where I am currently a 300-level student studying Computer Science. Throughout my journey, I have faced numerous challenges, but I am grateful for the unwavering support of my family, particularly my brother, Msugh Ortil ,who have been instrumental in my growth. I am proud of my resilience and look forward to achieving my goals.</p> <br>

    <p>I am so passionate about web development. I started been interested in web development in my first year at Benue state university where my friend by name <strong>Daanhwer James</strong>  used to stay hours coding. He succeeded in creating a website called <i><b><a href="www.zerobugs.ng">zerobugs</a></b></i> and lunched it. It enabled us to post materials where students can download and also register for our tutorials, though our dream for the website did not go as hoped because of our inability to contribute in skill, my heart was broken. I saw myself as useless but there came a burning desire within me..... And all I could thirst for was the knowledge of web development. My passion for these was sorely front end as i was too afraid of programming languages like <b>"JAVASCIPT"</b> but when I started my SIWES program I saw the future of me becoming a full stack developer, the words of encouragment by the manager of Luper technologies struck me hard, and i realized i can be the reason for my failure or success. I pray that as I walk this journey, may the Almighty God strengthen me to reach the peak of these knowledge.</p> <br>
